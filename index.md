# FTL event safety guide

Events can kill crew or damage hull. To reduce tedious wiki checks, here's a categorised guide. Some events appear in multiple categories.

I've picked memorable phrases from each event. Sometimes the phrase is from your *choice* text.

## Simple crew death events

These are simple binary choices. Is it safe to board that space station or not?

"Boarding" can be risky, but "examining" or "hailing them" is safe. Whenever you *send your crew*, expect to lose them. Clone bays cannot cure disease, but upgraded medbays can. There's an evil [teleporter blue option](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_research_station_with_no_response) that does not save your crew.

## Other crew death events

These events have more stages or nuances.

In the Smoldering Engi event, taking the Engi is "safe" because you always get the Engi. **Warning:** I don't (yet!) know what happens if you take the Engi when you only have 1 crew. Engi B beware!

## Hull damage events

Hull damage is usually worth risking, **unless you are low on hull**. Even low-scrap outcomes become attractive in later sectors.
