# FTL event safety guide

Events can kill crew or damage hull. To reduce tedious wiki checks, here's a categorised guide. Some events appear in multiple categories.

I've picked memorable phrases from each event. Sometimes the phrase is from your *choice* text.

## Simple crew death events

These are simple binary choices. Is it safe to board that space station or not?

Whenever you **send your crew**, expect to lose them. So "boarding" is risky, but "examining" or "hailing them" is safe. Clone bays cannot cure disease, but upgraded medbays can. There's an evil [teleporter blue option](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_research_station_with_no_response) that does not save your crew.

| Text cue | Crew death? | Medical counter | Aide-memoire |
|----------|:-----------:|:---------------:|--------------|

| [Malfunctioning Mantis](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Confused_Mantis) | &#8531; | Clone bay | Mantis may murderise |
| [Incapacitated ships](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships) | ⅕ | Clone bay | Manually search = danger. (Good reward) |

## Other crew death events

These events have more options, stages, or nuances.

| Text cue | Crew death? | Medical counter | Aide-memoire / notes|
|----------|:-----------:|:---------------:|---------------------|
| [Bring ... creatures to sell](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligent_Lifeform_on_Planet) | &frac12; | - | **Never** sell the space ponies! <sup>You monster</sup> |
| [Send your crew in a shuttle](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | &frac12; | Clone bay | Send crew = danger, fire = death |
| ...[dock and try to rescue](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | **Safe** | - | Docking, not sending crew. Risks 4 hull |
| [Smoldering Engi](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Engi_Research_Station) | **Safe** | Clone bay | Engi is "safe", drone needs clone |
| [Single life form](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | **Safe** | - | First stage always safe... |
| ...[mental state questionable](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | &frac14; | Clone bay | ...but madmen can kill, also risks 4 hull |
| [Rock live mine](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_Live_Mine) | &frac14; | Clone bay | Unavoidable. Also 6 hull damage |
| [Have your Engi negotiate](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/The_Engi_Virus) | Maybe! | - | No ship kill = dead Engi. **Single crew = LOSS** |
| [Accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | ⅙ | Clone bay | **Possible fleet advance too** |
| ...[reluctantly accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | ⅙ ** | Clone bay | ...same problems, but bugged |

\* In the Smoldering Engi event, taking the Engi is always "safe" because they replace any lost crew.  
** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg).

## Hull damage events

Hull damage is usually worth risking, **unless you are low on hull**. Even low-scrap outcomes become attractive in later sectors.

| Text cue | Damage amount | Damage chance | Assessment |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|------------|
| [Ship without life forms](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Dense_Asteroid_Field_Distress_Call) | 5 | &#8531; | Good reward |
| [Side with the fugitive](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Mantis_Fugitive) | 5 | &frac12;  | **Risky.** System damage + fight |
| ...[offer up the Mantis](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Mantis_Fugitive) | 5 | &#8531; | Better, unless you **really** want the Mantis |
| [Try to shield their ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon) | 1 or 4 | &#8532; | Good reward on average |
| ...[defense / repair drone](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon) | 4 | &frac12; | ...even better reward |
| [Try to dislodge the ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crushed_Pirate) | 2 | &frac12; | **Bad unless weak.** Destroy them instead |
| [Fire on the defense system](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Malfunction_Defense_System) | 5 | &frac12; | Poor value in sector 1 or 2 (Hard) |
| [Explore the asteroid field](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Large_asteroid_field) | 5 | &#8537; | Good value, risk of asteroid fight |
| [Approach the asteroid field](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Explore_the_System) | 5 | ⅙ | "Out of fuel" event |
| [Slug repair station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Slug_Repair_Station) | 5, after repair | ⅓ | Usually worth taking; may need to run |

The following events were already covered in the "crew death" sections, but they also deal hull damage. Here they are again:
