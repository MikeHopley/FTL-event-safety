# FTL event safety guide

FTL contains many events that can kill crew or damage your hull. Even after years of playing, I still get paranoid and look some up [on the wiki](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Events). It doesn't help that some events have similar text but very different outcomes, and some events have multiple, randomly selected text introductions.

I made this guide as an aid to memorisation. From each event, I've picked out memorable phrases like "damaged and dilapidated" or "smoldering Engi". These cues help you recognise the event; sometimes the best cue is from your choices, not the intro text. I've also looked for simple ways to remember the outcomes or medical system requirements.

To keep this simple, I'm only considering crew deaths and instant event-based hull damage. For example, I'm saying that [Abandoned space station] is "safe", even though you might get a ship fight with an ASB.

Some events have blue options. A blue option is **always** safe, although not necessarily the best choice in all situations.

## Crew death events

The first group of events are simple binary choices. Is it safe to board that space station or not?

The general pattern is that "boarding" can be risky, but "examining" or "hailing them" is safe. Whenever you *send your crew*, expect to lose them. In some cases a clone bay or upgraded medbay can save them. Clone bays cannot cure disease, and upgraded medbays only cure disease in only one event.

| Event | Text cue | Crew death? | Medical counter | Aide memoire

[Abandoned space station] | Move in to examine the station | **Safe** | - | "Move in to examine" is safe. It's not like you're *boarding* them
[Damaged space station] | Damaged and dilapidated | 1/3 | Medbay 2 | **D**amaged and **D**ilapidated means **D**isease (can't clone)
[Unknown disease on mining colony] | Unknown disease | 1/2 | - | **Disease**, so can't clone. Only take blue options
[Zoltan Great Eye] | Great Eye | 1/4 | - | Reverse aging, not dying, so can't clone
[Giant alien spiders] | SPIDERS | 1/2 | Clone bay |  Giant spiders can kill. No joke
