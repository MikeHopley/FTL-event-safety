# FTL event safety guide

Events can kill crew, damage hull, or advance the Rebel fleet. The wiki has a useful [negative consequences](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Negative_Consequences) super-category page.

To reduce tedious wiki checks, here's a categorised guide. I've picked memorable phrases from each event. Sometimes the phrase is from your *choice* text.

## Simple crew death events

These are simple binary choices. Is it safe to board that space station or not?

Whenever you **send your crew**, expect to lose them. So "boarding" is risky, but "examining" or "hailing them" is safe. Clonebays cannot cure disease, but upgraded medbays can. There's an evil [teleporter blue option](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_research_station_with_no_response) that does not save your crew.

| Text cue | Crew death?* | Medical counter | Aide-memoire |
|----------|:-----------:|:---------------:|--------------|
| No response to hails [#1](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_research_station_with_no_response), [#2](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Merchant%27s_Request) | 1/3 | Medbay 2 | **N**o **H**ails = **N**eeds **H**ealing |
| [Move in to examine the station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_Space_Station) | **Safe**  | - | "Move in to examine" is safe |
| [Damaged and dilapidated](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Damaged_Space_Station) | 1/3 | Medbay 2 | **D**amaged and **D**ilapidated = **D**isease |
| [Unknown disease](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Disease_on_Mining_Colony) | Always | - | **Disease**, so can't clone. Only take blue options |
| [Refugee drifting](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Drifting_Refugee_Ship) | **Safe** | - | "Hail them" is always safe |
| [Refugee comms down](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Refugee_Ship_with_Communications_Down) | 1/4 | Clonebay | **C**omms **D**own = **C**annibal **D**icks |
| [Great Eye](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Zoltan_%22Great_Eye%22) | 1/4 | - | Reverse aging, not dying, so can't clone |
| [Giant alien spiders](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Alien_Spiders) | 1/2 | Clonebay | Giant spiders can kill. No joke |
| [Malfunctioning Mantis](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Confused_Mantis) | 1/2 | Clonebay | Mantis may murderise |
| [Pry it open](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_Pod_Floating_Nearby) | 1/3 | Clonebay | Mantis may murderise |
| [Incapacitated ships](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships) | 1/5 | Clonebay | Manually search = danger. (Good reward) |
| [Send some crew to help](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Slug_Oxygen_Malfunction) (Slugs) | 1/3 | Clonebay | Send crew to help Slugs? Seriously? |

## Other crew death events

These events have more options, stages, or nuances. I'm leaving out obvious choices like "give up your crew member".

| Text cue | Crew death?* | Medical counter | Aide-memoire / notes|
|----------|:-----------:|:---------------:|---------------------|
| [Bring ... creatures to sell](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligent_Lifeform_on_Planet) | Always | (Clonebay) | **Never** sell the space ponies! <sup>You monster</sup> |
| [Send your crew in a shuttle](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | 1/2 | Clonebay | Send crew = danger, fire = death |
| ...[dock and try to rescue](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | **Safe** | - | Docking, not sending crew. Risks 4 hull |
| [Smoldering Engi](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Engi_Research_Station) | **Safe** | Clonebay | Engi is "safe"\*\*, drone needs clone |
| [Single life form](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | **Safe** | - | First stage always safe... |
| ...[mental state questionable](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | 1/3 | Clonebay | ...but madmen can kill, also risks 4 hull |
| [Rock live mine](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_Live_Mine) | 1/4 | Clonebay | Unavoidable. Also 6 hull damage |
| [Have your Engi negotiate](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/The_Engi_Virus) | Maybe! | - | No ship kill = dead Engi. **Single crew = LOSS** |
| [Accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 | Clonebay | Messy. I don't take this |
| ...[reluctantly accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 *** | Clonebay | ...same, but bugged |
| [Allow them to run tests](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crystalline_Research_Facility) | 1/3 | Clonebay | Swaps crew for weapon |
| [Send an away team](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Drifting_Debris) (no fuel) | 1/4 | - | Send crew = danger. (Can avert with scrap) |

\* Ignores "nothing" outcomes, as they are irrelevant for evaluating risk vs. reward  
** Taking the Engi is "safe" because they replace any lost crew (but you might lose skills). "Save yourselves" is 100% safe  
*** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg)

## Hull damage events

Hull damage is usually worth risking, **unless you are low on hull**. Even low-scrap outcomes become attractive in later sectors.

| Text cue | Damage amount | Damage chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------------:|:--------------:|------------|
| [Investigate the battlefield](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Nebula_seen_Ships_Exchange_Fire) (nebula) | 5 | 1/2 | Bad without clonebay or medbay-2 |

| [Side with the fugitive](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Mantis_Fugitive) | 5 | 1/2  | **Risky.** System damage + fight |

| [Try to dislodge the ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crushed_Pirate) | 2 | 1/2 | **Bad unless weak.** Destroy them instead |

| [...fire on the defense system](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Malfunction_Defense_System) | 5 | 1/2 | Poor value in sector 1 or 2 (Hard) |
| [Steal the civilian supplies](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebels_Supplying_Civilians) | 2 | 1/3 | Worth it |
| [Explore the asteroid field](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Large_asteroid_field) | 5 | 1/5 | Good value (risk of asteroid fight) |

| [Buy nothing](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Merchant_with_Conspicuous_Markings) (conspicuous ship) | 3 | Always | Attack them instead |
| [Dock with the refueling platform](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Orbiting_Small_Platform) | 3 | ~2/5 | Ignore unless desperate for fuel |
| ...[quickly dock and refuel](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Orbiting_Small_Platform) | 3 | 1/2 | Skip unless at 0 fuel |
| [Demand the Rock ship pay](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Slug_and_Rock_Standoff#Slug_reward) | 5 | 1/3 | Usually worth taking |
| [Capture the ship intact](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Unencrypted_Communication_Channel) | **15** | "Always" | You were warned. THREE times! |

The following events were already covered in the "crew death" sections, but they also deal hull damage. Here they are again:
 
| Text cue | Damage amount | Damage chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------------:|:--------------:|------------|
| [Dock and try to rescue](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | 4 | 1/2 | Good value |

*** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg)

## Fleet advance events

Some events can advance the Rebel fleet by 1 move.

| Text cue | Chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------:|------------|
| [Leave them to their fate](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon) | 1/2** | Avoid unless low on hull |
| [Go looking for the Rebel ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Ship_Nearby) | 1/3 | Okay, as you still get to fight them |
| [Prepare to chase them!](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Ship_in_Nebula) | 1/2 | *Maybe* worth it in Uncharted Nebula  |
| [Attempt to manually hack into the station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Auto-Ship_sits_Dormant) | 1/3 | (Possible map reveal) Probably not worth it |
| [Attempt to remain concealed](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Stationed_Rebel_Ship) (Rebel) | 1/3** | Fight them instead |

| [Wait](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crystalline_Men_Buried) (buried Crystal men) | Always | Probably not worth it <sup>I've never even seen this event</sup> |
| [Do a full system scan](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Nebula_seen_Ships_Exchange_Fire) | Always | Unavoidable at this point |

And once again, here's our old friend:

| Text cue | Chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------:|------------|
| [Accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 | Messy. I don't take this |
| ...[reluctantly accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 *** | ...same, but bugged |

\* Ignores "nothing" outcomes, as they are irrelevant for evaluating risk vs. reward  
** For these events I'm **including** the "nothing" outcome, since there is no "do nothing" option  
*** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg)
