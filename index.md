# FTL event safety guide

Events can kill crew, damage hull, or inflict other penalties. To reduce tedious wiki checks, here's a categorised guide.

I've picked memorable phrases from each event. Sometimes the phrase is from your *choice* text.

## Simple crew death events

These are simple binary choices. Is it safe to board that space station or not?

Whenever you **send your crew**, expect to lose them. So "boarding" is risky, but "examining" or "hailing them" is safe. Clone bays cannot cure disease, but upgraded medbays can. There's an evil [teleporter blue option](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_research_station_with_no_response) that does not save your crew.

| Text cue | Crew death?* | Medical counter | Aide-memoire |
|----------|:-----------:|:---------------:|--------------|
| No response to hails [#1](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_research_station_with_no_response), [#2](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Merchant%27s_Request) | 1/3 | Medbay 2 | **N**o **H**ails = **N**eeds **H**ealing |
| [Move in to examine the station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_Space_Station) | **Safe**  | - | "Move in to examine" is safe |
| [Damaged and dilapidated](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Damaged_Space_Station) | 1/3 | Medbay 2 | **D**amaged and **D**ilapidated = **D**isease |
| [Unknown disease](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Disease_on_Mining_Colony) | Always | - | **Disease**, so can't clone. Only take blue options |
| [Refugee drifting](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Drifting_Refugee_Ship) | **Safe** | - | "Hail them" is always safe |
| [Refugee comms down](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Refugee_Ship_with_Communications_Down) | 1/4 | Clone bay | **C**omms **D**own = **C**annibal **D**icks |
| [Great Eye](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Zoltan_%22Great_Eye%22) | 1/4 | - | Reverse aging, not dying, so can't clone |
| [Giant alien spiders](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Alien_Spiders) | 1/2 | Clone bay | Giant spiders can kill. No joke |
| [Malfunctioning Mantis](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Confused_Mantis) | 1/2 | Clone bay | Mantis may murderise |
| [Incapacitated ships](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships) | 1/5 | Clone bay | Manually search = danger. (Good reward) |

\* Ignores "nothing" outcomes, as they are irrelevant for evaluating risk vs. reward

## Other crew death events

These events have more options, stages, or nuances.

| Text cue | Crew death?* | Medical counter | Aide-memoire / notes|
|----------|:-----------:|:---------------:|---------------------|
| [Bring ... creatures to sell](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligent_Lifeform_on_Planet) | Always | - | **Never** sell the space ponies! <sup>You monster</sup> |
| [Send your crew in a shuttle](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | 1/2 | Clone bay | Send crew = danger, fire = death |
| ...[dock and try to rescue](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | **Safe** | - | Docking, not sending crew. Risks 4 hull |
| [Smoldering Engi](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Engi_Research_Station) | **Safe** | Clone bay | Engi is safe**, drone needs clone |
| [Single life form](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | **Safe** | - | First stage always safe... |
| ...[mental state questionable](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | 1/3 | Clone bay | ...but madmen can kill, also risks 4 hull |
| [Rock live mine](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_Live_Mine) | 1/4 | Clone bay | Unavoidable. Also 6 hull damage |
| [Have your Engi negotiate](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/The_Engi_Virus) | Maybe! | - | No ship kill = dead Engi. **Single crew = LOSS** |
| [Accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 | Clone bay | Messy. I don't take this |
| ...[reluctantly accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 *** | Clone bay | ...same, but bugged |
| [Leave your crew member behind](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crystalline_Men_Buried) | Always | - | Bad option<sup>what did you expect?</sup> |

\* Ignores "nothing" outcomes, as they are irrelevant for evaluating risk vs. reward  
** In the Smoldering Engi event, taking the Engi is always "safe" because they replace any lost crew.   
*** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg).

## Hull damage events

Hull damage is usually worth risking, **unless you are low on hull**. Even low-scrap outcomes become attractive in later sectors.

| Text cue | Damage amount | Damage chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------------:|:--------------:|------------|
| [Ship without life forms](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Dense_Asteroid_Field_Distress_Call) | 5 | 1/3 | Good reward |
| [Side with the fugitive](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Mantis_Fugitive) | 5 | 1/2  | **Risky.** System damage + fight |
| ...[offer up the Mantis](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Mantis_Fugitive) | 5 | 1/3 | Better, unless you **really** want the Mantis |
| [Try to shield their ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon) | 1 or 4 | 2/3 | Good reward on average |
| ...[defense / repair drone](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon) | 4 | 1/2 | ...even better reward |
| [Try to dislodge the ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crushed_Pirate) | 2 | 1/2 | **Bad unless weak.** Destroy them instead |
| [Fire on the defense system](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Malfunction_Defense_System) | 5 | 1/2 | Poor value in sector 1 or 2 (Hard) |
| [Steal the civilian supplies](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebels_Supplying_Civilians) | 2 | 1/3 | Worth it |
| [Explore the asteroid field](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Large_asteroid_field) | 5 | 1/5 | Good value, risk of asteroid fight |
| [Approach the asteroid field](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Explore_the_System) | 5 | 1/5 | "Out of fuel" event |
| [Slug repair station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Slug_Repair_Station) | 5, after repair | 1/3 | Usually worth taking; may need to run |

The following events were already covered in the "crew death" sections, but they also deal hull damage. Here they are again:
 
| Text cue | Damage amount | Damage chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------------:|:--------------:|------------|
| [Dock and try to rescue](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_on_Small_Research_Station) | 4 | 1/2 | Good value |
| [Rock live mine](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_Live_Mine) | 6 | 1/4 | Missile blue option is 4 damage (saves crew) |
| [Mental state questionable](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Single_Life_Form_on_Moon) | 4 | 1/3 | Worth it, with clone bay |
| [Accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 2 or 3 | 1/3 | Messy. I don't take this |
| ...[reluctantly accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 2 or 3 | 1/3 *** | ...same, but bugged |

\* Ignores "nothing" outcomes, as they are irrelevant for evaluating risk vs. reward   
*** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg).

## Fleet advance events

Some events can advance the Rebel fleet by 1 move.

| Text cue | Chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------:|------------|
| [Leave them to their fate](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon) | 1/2** | Avoid unless low on hull |
| [Go looking for the Rebel ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Ship_Nearby) | 1/3 | Okay, as you still get to fight them |
| [Prepare to chase them!](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Ship_in_Nebula) | 1/2 | *Maybe* worth it in Uncharted Nebula  |
| [Attempt to manually hack into the station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Auto-Ship_sits_Dormant) | 1/3 | (Possible map reveal) Probably not worth it |
| [Attempt to remain concealed](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Stationed_Rebel_Ship) (Rebel) | 1/3** | Fight them instead |
| [Interfere - make first contact](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Zoltan_Trade_Hub) | Always | **Terrible** |
| [Attack the Crystalline ship](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crystalline_Ship_Engaged_with_Rebel) | Always | **Bad** |
| [Give them your flight plans](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crystalline_ship_messaging_about_Rebels) | Always | Lie to them instead |
| [Wait](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Crystalline_Men_Buried) (buried Crystal men) | Always | Probably not worth it <sup>I've never even seen this event</sup> |

And once again, here's our old friend:

| Text cue | Chance* | Assessment |
|----------|:-------:|------------|
| [Accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 | Messy. I don't take this |
| ...[reluctantly accept his proposal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector) | 1/6 *** | ...same, but bugged |

\* Ignores "nothing" outcomes, as they are irrelevant for evaluating risk vs. reward  
** For these events I'm **including** the "nothing" outcome, since there is no "do nothing" option  
*** The Rebel Defector event is bugged: if you get a second offer, [a crew icon indicates safety](https://imgur.com/a/LNQNnUg).
