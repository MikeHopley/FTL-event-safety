# FTL event safety guide

FTL contains many events that can kill crew or damage hull. To reduce tedious wiki checks, here's a guide to remembering them.

I've picked memorable phrases from each event. Sometimes the phrase is from your *choice* text, instead of the *intro* text.

## Simple crew death events

The first group of events are simple binary choices. Is it safe to board that space station or not?

The general pattern is that "boarding" can be risky, but "examining" or "hailing them" is safe. Whenever you *send your crew*, expect to lose them. In some cases a clone bay or upgraded medbay can save them. Clone bays cannot cure disease, and upgraded medbays only cure disease in one event.
